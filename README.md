# moist_thermodynamics

## Description
This repository contains constants and functions used for the analysis of moist thermodynamic processes.  An effort is made to be as accurate as possible given the assumption of a Rankine-Kirchoff fluid, i.e., zero condensate volume, perfect mixtures of perfect gases, perfect liquids and constancy of specific heats.  

In some cases even more exact treatments will be desired, for instance the more accurate specifications of the saturation vapor pressure are not consistent with the assumptions of a Rankine-Kirchoff fluid, but these will generally be the exception.  More accurate formulations are available, for instansce, using the IAPWS package or its deriviatives. 

## Usage
Jupyter notebooks provide illustrative use cases and further informatino pursuant to choices made in structuring the code, and the functionality it enables.
